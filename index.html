    <p>I'm Bri, thanks for stopping by! <span class="grey-text">(hey! that rhymed!)</span></p>

    <p>I’m a software engineer by day, cozy coder by night. I enjoy making personal finance apps, educational
        tools, games, and low-cost apps that help small businesses solve problems.
        I love both the fast-paced team-oriented ethos of professional software engineering <b>and</b> the DIY spirit of
        the hobbyist developer. Since I was young I’ve always been enamoured by those who could code. I was mostly
        exposed to these technical individuals through the games I played and the community of modders who enhanced
        them; their ability to make their ideas come alive struck me with inspiration. I try to capture that DIY spirit
        in my work, which spans the spectrum from light-hearted to serious. Please enjoy perusing my portfolio, and
        contact me via email if you're interested in learning more about any of my projects.</p>
